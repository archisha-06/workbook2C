<div class="top-right-caption">The website by Active Theory has been a huge
  source of inspiration for mine—especially in how it balances interactivity
   with aesthetic precision. I love how their site feels immersive without 
   being overwhelming; the animations are smooth, purposeful, and always 
   support the content rather than distract from it. That’s something I’ve 
   tried to apply to my own site—creating subtle motion, like floating links
   and animated backgrounds, to bring the page to life. I’m also really drawn
    to their use of dark themes with glowing, neon-like elements, which
     aligns with the cyberpunk-tech style I’ve been developing. The site 
     feels more like an experience than just a portfolio, and that’s the 
     direction I want to head in: something interactive, visually cohesive, 
     and just a bit futuristic.

<div class="bottom-left-caption">Rain Room by Random International really 
  stuck with me. There’s something so beautiful about the way it gives people 
  this quiet control over a natural force, like you’re parting the rain just 
  by existing. The motion sensors respond to where you walk, so it feels like
   the environment is listening to you in real time. It’s kind of surreal, 
   but also calming in a way.

That idea of responsive space definitely inspired parts of my own work. 
Some of my falling number backgrounds were actually influenced by
 it—especially the way the rain in Rain Room creates this constant digital 
 flow, but pauses the moment you interact with it. I loved that contrast and 
 wanted to bring a bit of that into my site. It reminded me that tech doesn’t
  always have to scream for attention—it can also whisper, react, and create 
  a space that feels alive with you in it..
