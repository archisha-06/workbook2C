       This week, we got introduced to the basics of physical computing and started getting 
       comfortable with Arduino. We went through all the tools in our kits and did an activity
        where we labeled each one, basically a crash course in “what’s this thing called again?”
         Surprisingly helpful, especially when everything starts to look the same.

Our first task was to build a simple circuit that turns an LED on and off with a switch. 
Nothing too fancy, but it was satisfying to see the light actually respond...felt a bit like 
giving life to a potato-powered robot. Baby steps, but a solid start.

       We rebuilt the same circuit, but this time swapped the switch for a tilt sensor. 
       Now, instead of just turning on and off, the LED would brighten or dim depending on 
       the sensor’s angle. Honestly, it felt a bit like we gave the light feelings—"tilt me
        gently and I’ll shine for you, tilt me too much and I’ll sulk."

      It was a fun way to explore analog input and see how small changes in a circuit 
      can totally shift its behavior. Definitely made me think more about how these basic
       interactions could be used in real-life projects—like making lights react to
        movement or building something that responds to its environment.
