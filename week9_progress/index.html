<div class="top-right-caption">I picked up the pace a bit and started working 
  on individual page layouts. Instead of keeping everything uniform, I wanted
   each project to have its own little vibe. For example, on the sound project
    page, I added a sound wave animation that actually reacts to audio 
    input.. felt like a fun way to make the page sound like itself.

For the light sensor project, I went with stars and a glowing trail—something 
a bit dreamy and reactive, just like the project itself. I also wrapped 
up the layouts for the progress and research pages. Nothing too fancy, but
enough to feel like they belong in the same universe while still doing their 
own thing.

<div class="bottom-left-caption">I made the background for week 9 landing page
  and got inspiration from 
  <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/math-and-physics-game-of-life/" style="color: white;">P5.js Website</a>
  . Then I finished adding all the content and made some final touches to the website.
