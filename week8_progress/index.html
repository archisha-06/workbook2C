<div class="top-right-caption">I started adding text and links to
   my Week 7 landing page and decided to give it a bit more life 
   with some animations. I made the links float around the 
   heading, kind of like they’re orbiting it, giving the page a nice,
    dynamic feel instead of everything just sitting still.

    After that, I brought in the p5 background I made last week and 
    added it to the webpage. It tied the whole cyberpunk-tech vibe 
    together pretty nicely and made the page feel more like a digital 
    space rather than just another flat layout.

<div class="bottom-left-caption">I made a few more p5.js sketches to keep the 
  aesthetic of my website consistent—still sticking with that glitchy, techy 
  vibe. One idea I had was to create a current-like visual that connects my 
  Project 1 and Project 2 links, kind of like a digital thread running through
   them. It’s subtle, but it helps everything feel more connected (literally 
   and visually).

  I also started working on the individual project pages, setting up the basic 
  layout and adding some simple animations to keep things lively without going 
  overboard. It’s all still a work in progress, but it’s starting to feel more 
  cohesive—like each section belongs to the same world.
