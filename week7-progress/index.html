<div class="top-right-caption">In Week 7, I started building the home/landing page for my Workbook 2C.
   I decided to stick with the cyberpunk-tech aesthetic I used in my previous workbook, but this time I 
   wanted to push it further and make it feel more refined—less chaotic, more intentional.

I edited a PNG of a computer and wrapped text around it, just to give it that layered, glitchy feel. Then
 I had the idea to actually place my links inside the screen of the computer, which felt like a nice little 
 interactive touch that fit the theme. It sounded simple enough in my head, but getting the placement right
  took a fair bit of fiddling—things kept shifting or looking slightly off.

After some trial and error (and a bit of squinting at the screen wondering why everything was one pixel 
to the left), I finally got everything lined up.

<div class="textbox">p5 experiment for week 7</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom-left-caption">I wanted to make my weekly pages more interactive by integrating
  p5 sketches in my html webpages. So I tried a glitching number webcam effect for my week 7 background.
  I got a lot of inspiration from pinterest and browsing through many tech websites.
