      For this project, we built an ultrasonic buzzer that could detect distance and react with sound.
       Basically, the closer something got to the sensor, the more the buzzer would panic like a robot version of 
       personal space issues.

      The setup involved using an ultrasonic sensor to measure how far an object was, and then triggering the buzzer 
      based on that distance. We also displayed the live distance readings on the serial monitor, which was helpful for 
      understanding how the sensor was picking up changes in real time. Watching the numbers shift as we moved our hands 
      back and forth felt oddly satisfying like playing tag with invisible waves.

       For the next project, we stuck some wires into a potato and connected it 
       to the circuit to see what would happen (science!). The idea was to use the potato as a sort of touch sensor, 
       where the buzzer would change its sound depending on how the wires were interacting with it.

      When we inserted the wires into different parts of the potato, the buzzer gave off different sounds.
       We also experimented by wrapping some of the wires in aluminum foil, which changed the conductivity and gave
        us a variety of frequencies. Honestly, it started to feel more like we were making a low-budget synth than doing
        a standard Arduino project.
